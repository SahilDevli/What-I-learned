To handle tabular files in Python and perform file operations comprehensively, you can follow these steps:

1. Understand File Formats
CSV (Comma-Separated Values): Common format for tabular data.
Excel Files (XLSX): Use libraries like openpyxl or pandas for reading/writing.
JSON: Often used for semi-structured data.
Text Files: With delimited values (e.g., tab-delimited).

2. Libraries to Learn
csv: Built-in library for basic CSV file handling.
pandas: For advanced tabular data manipulation and conversion.
os / shutil: For file management tasks.
json: For handling JSON files.
